## [basic-io.c](https://github.com/KatiesTruong/c_programming/blob/master/basic-io.c)
Simple program that requests input from the user of 3 integers and a float.
```scanf()``` and ```printf()``` formats the following data inputs of strings, integers and floats.

## [switch.c](https://github.com/KatiesTruong/c_programming/blob/master/swtich.c)
Declares an ``enum`` function that lists all the variables inside it. Then passes its arguments through ``options``. ``options`` is used in main with ``opt`` declared as the third case.
``printf()`` prints the case twice because it's concatenated with *+ 1*.
